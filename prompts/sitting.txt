TASK:
Given this URDF file of a humanoid robot, give me the joint angles to set on the robot in order to assume a sitting down pose. 
The robot default position is arms at its sides.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Give me the list of joint angles in radians
- Embed the joint angles of the pose in a dictionary with the name of the joint as Key and its radians as Value
- The joint name convention must be coherent with the urdf file. 
- Avoid writing comments

All axes are defined in a right-handed robot-fixed frame where:

    +X = Forward (direction the robot faces).
    +Y = Left.
    +Z = Up.
